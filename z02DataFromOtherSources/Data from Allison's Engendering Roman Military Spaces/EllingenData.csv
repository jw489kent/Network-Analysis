In the arched recesses are leaves on fine trendrils, which - where there is space - roll out in spirals and are provided with small sprig hooks Sprossenhäkchen. Outside the main swinging arched line, above and in the centre, are found two pointed finely notched leaves (ivy leaves?), below are probably two leaves of the the same type arranged opposite each other, the poor preservation today allows no sure decision.
