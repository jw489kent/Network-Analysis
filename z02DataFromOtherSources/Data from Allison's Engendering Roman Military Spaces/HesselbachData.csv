M0001 ,66/27,0.00000,0.00000,Hesselbach,1.00,dress,D,Copper alloy,,Brooches,,"Moulded bronze brooch with spiral casing open underneath; pin and spiral lost; spiral probably provided with over tendon, held with a tendon hook similar to an example from Saalburg (fig. 40.2 - Saalburg inv. no. S 00/223). The wide foot, moulded in the same piece, is broken. Brooch badly corroded, so that only traces remain of the stepped decoration on the top of the bow. The brooch type is seldom found in Upper Germany; it is called a  ""Delphinfibel"". Parallels especially from Saalburg (A. Böhme, Saalburg-Jahrb. 27, 1970,  5ff., esp. 8f. 15 fig. 3), there also according to the dating (Flavian-Trajanic) and the spread fo the brooch type, originated doubtlessly from Britain. The concentration of the distribution is in central England and south Wales -  from a brief inquiry based on photos and drawings M. R. Hüll, Colchester, established the British origin of this Hesselbach brooch;  I thank him for the friendly effort. He placed the brooch in his group  ""Polden Hill D"" which he dates  70-120 AD.  For parallel finds in Britain for the  Hesselbach brooch Fibel he places a piece from legionary fortress Caerleon espeically near (National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, inv. no. 54. 389 a, F 14).
